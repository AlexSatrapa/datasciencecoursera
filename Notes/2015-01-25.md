# Interesting Points

"Statistics is the science of learning from data" — Jeff Leek

## Why do we like R so much?

 - Increasingly broad adoption in Data Science circles.
 - It's Free and it's free
 - comprehensive set of packages
 - development environment "Rstudio"
 - developer ecosystem

## Goals

Venn diagram:

 - Hacking Skills (H)
 - Math & Statistics Knowledge (M)
 - Substantive Expertise (S)
 - H & M = Machine Learning
 - H & S = Danger Zone (?)
 - M & S = Traditional Research
 - intersection: Data science

Hacking skills: programming R, and ability to go out and answer questions for yourself.

# Lecture Notes — Data Scientist's Toolbox

Brief introduction to R script, R markdown.

Brief introduction to GitHub.

## What do data scientists do?

 - Define the question
 - Define the ideal data set
 - Determine what data you can access
 - Obtain the data
 - Clean the data
 - Exploratory data analysis
 - Statistical prediction/modelling
 - Interpret results
 - Challenge results
 - Synthesise/write up results
 - Create reproducible code
 - Distribute results to other people

# Lecture Notes - Getting Help

Message board with vote on questions & responses from peers and instructors.

*If you see a question that you have already solved, make sure you answer it!*

R functions:

 - ?rnorm
 - help.search("rnorm")
 - args("rnorm")
 - rnorm  (with no brackets, will produce function signature)

Usual "bug report" question asking:

 - Reproduction steps
 - What was expected result?
 - What actual result?
 - How have you tried to solve it already?

"Data analysis" question:

 - What question are you trying to answer?
 - What did you do to try to answer it? (steps/tools)
 - What expected result?
 - What actual result?
 - What other solutions have you thought about?

Question titles should be specific:

 - "R 2.15.0 lm() function produces seg fault with large data fram, Mac OS X 10.6.3" rather than "HELP: Can't fit linear model!"

Help site etiquette:

 - Describe the goal
 - Be explicit
 - Be succinct (provide minimum information to avoid flooding)
 - Be courteous
 - FOLLOW UP and [post solutions](https://xkcd.com/979/)
 - User forums rather than email

# Lecture Notes — Finding Answers

Key characteristics of hackers:
 - Willing to find answers on their own
 - Knowledgeable about where to find answers
 - Unintimidated by new stuff (in fact they relish it)
 - Willing to admit they don't know the answer

Where to find answers:

 - R programming http://bit.ly/Ufaadn ([YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY), Roger Peng)
 - R mailing list or Stackoverflow
 - CrossValidated for data analysis & statistics questions
 - StackOverflow (use the [r] tag)

# Lecture Notes — R Programming Overview

 - data types
 - subsetting
 - reading and writing data
 - control structures
 - functions
 - scoping
 - vectorised operations
 - dates and times
 - debugging
 - simulation
 - optimisation


# Lecture Notes - Getting and Cleaning Data Content

 - Raw Vs Tidy
 - Downloading
 - Reading
 - Merging
 - Reshaping
 - Summarising
 - Finding and Replacing
 - Data Resources

## Connecting and listing databases

As an example of R database laundry:

    mergedData2 <- merge(reviews, solutions, by.x = "solution_id", by.y = "id", all = True)
    head(mergedData2[,1:6], 3)
    reviews[1, 1:6]

## Raw vs Processed

Raw is:

 - Original Source
 - Often hard to use for data analyses
 - May only need to be processed once

Processed data:

 - Ready for analysis
 - Processed through merge, subset, transform and other mechanisms
 - Processing standards
 - All steps should be recorded

# Lecture Notes — Installing Rtools

Windows only.
